# :smile_cat: The Cat Neovim config :smile_cat:

An awesomly cool and blazingly fast nvim config.

## :heart_eyes_cat: The Cat full setup :heart_eyes_cat:

I am a windows 10 user (I know i suck thank you).
If you use windows as well and want to use neovim as your editor I recommend you to build neovim from source using cygwin and ninja.
To get a fully customize terminal experience i also use [wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) coupled with [clink](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink).
You can find my configuration for both of them here : [wezterm-config](https://github.com/theCat69/wezterm-config) & [clink-config](https://github.com/theCat69/clink-config).
